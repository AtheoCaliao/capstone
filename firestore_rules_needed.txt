FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES FOR YOUR PROJECT
==========================================

Current Project: capstone-c98f9

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/capstone-c98f9/firestore/rules

OPTION 1 - For Development/Testing (Not secure for production):
----------------------------------------------------------------
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

OPTION 2 - For Production (Requires Authentication):
----------------------------------------------------
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /checkup_records/{recordId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /prenatal_records/{recordId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /immunization_records/{recordId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /patient_records/{recordId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

WHICH ONE TO USE?
-----------------
- Use OPTION 1 if you're just testing and want it to work immediately
- Use OPTION 2 if you have Firebase Authentication set up (users must be logged in)

After updating rules:
1. Click "Publish" in Firebase Console
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for rules to propagate
3. Try saving a record again

COMMON ERRORS:
--------------
❌ "permission-denied" = Your rules are blocking writes
   → Update to OPTION 1 or 2 above

❌ "not-found" = Collection doesn't exist yet
   → This is normal! First write will create it

❌ "unauthenticated" = Using OPTION 2 but not logged in
   → Make sure you're logged in to your app first
