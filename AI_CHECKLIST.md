## Quick Test

### Step 1: Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### Step 2: Create Test Record
1. Click "+ Add Check-Up"
2. Fill in:
   - Name: "Test Patient"
   - Age: 45
   - Symptoms: "severe chest pain"
   - BP: 180/120
3. Click "Save"

### Step 3: View Classification
1. Click on the newly created record
2. Scroll to "AI Classification" section
3. You should see:
   - Category: Emergency (Red)
   - Severity: Critical (Red)
   - Confidence: ~90%+
   - Keywords: chest pain, severe

### ✅ If You See This → SUCCESS!

## Classification Examples

### Test Case 1: Emergency
**Input:**
- Symptoms: "severe chest pain, difficulty breathing"
- BP: 180/120, HR: 110

**Expected:**
- Category: 🔴 Emergency
- Severity: 🔴 Critical
- Confidence: 90%+

### Test Case 2: Communicable
**Input:**
- Symptoms: "fever, cough, sore throat"
- Temp: 38.5°C

**Expected:**
- Category: 🟠 Communicable Disease
- Severity: 🟡 Medium
- Confidence: 80%+

### Test Case 3: Non-Communicable
**Input:**
- Symptoms: "diabetes checkup, high blood sugar"
- BP: 140/90, Age: 60

**Expected:**
- Category: 🔵 Non-Communicable Disease
- Severity: 🟡 Medium
- Confidence: 75%+

### Test Case 4: Routine
**Input:**
- Symptoms: "annual wellness visit"
- BP: 120/80, Temp: 37.0

**Expected:**
- Category: 🟢 Routine Checkup
- Severity: 🟢 Low
- Confidence: 70%+

## Verification Steps

### ✅ Check Console Logs
Look for these messages when app starts:
```
✅ [AI] TensorFlow Lite model loaded successfully
   OR
⚠️ [AI] TFLite model not found, using rule-based classification
```
Both are fine! Rule-based is default.

### ✅ Check Record Creation
When saving a record, console should show:
```
Classifying health record...
Category: Emergency
Severity: Critical
Confidence: 95%
```

### ✅ Check UI Display
In record details, you should see:
- 🧠 AI Classification header
- Method badge (ML Model or Rule-Based)
- Two badges: Category + Severity
- Confidence progress bar
- Keywords (if detected)

## Troubleshooting

### ❓ No AI Classification Section?
**Check:**
- Record has symptoms filled in
- Saved after AI integration
- Old records won't have AI data (only new ones)

### ❓ Low Confidence Scores?
**Try:**
- Be more specific with symptoms
- Include vital signs (improves accuracy)
- Add patient age

### ❓ Wrong Classifications?
**Adjust:**
- Add keywords in `health_ai_classifier.dart`
- Modify vital sign thresholds
- Train custom model with your data

### ❓ "Model not found" Warning?
**This is normal!**
- System uses rule-based (works great)
- Train ML model only if you need higher accuracy
- No action required

## Performance Benchmarks

### Rule-Based Mode
- ⚡ Speed: <10ms
