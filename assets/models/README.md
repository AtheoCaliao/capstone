# TensorFlow Lite Model Directory

## Current Status

This directory will contain your trained TensorFlow Lite model.

### Required Files

1. **health_classifier.tflite** - The trained model (generated by training script)
2. **encoders.json** - Label encoders (automatically generated)

### To Generate the Model

Run the training script:

```bash
cd ../train_model
python train_health_classifier.py
```

The model will be automatically saved to this directory.

### Using Without Model

If no model is present, the system automatically falls back to **rule-based classification**, which works perfectly fine for most use cases. You'll see this in the console:

```
⚠️ [AI] TFLite model not found, using rule-based classification
```

This is completely normal and expected behavior.

### Model Info
